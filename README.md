## Dev Time Tracker
Timer for developers that logs the number of hours worked. Keep track of time spent at work on a task: when coding with the afk / lockscreen feature, or without it when you are going to a meeting or your daily scrum. Pause, resume and reset the timer at any time. Use the settings to customize it your way.
